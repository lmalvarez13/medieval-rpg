# Medieval RPG 
## About this project
This project is an RPG Diablo-like game where the player will have to combat grumpy enemies who took a whole town as prisioners.

In this short adventure, the player will be able to switch weapons of different styles: Swords, Bows and Magic Attacks, while defeating enemies and leveling up to get stronger both in combat stats and health points. The scenery fit the medieval low-poly style, whilst being inmerful in a fantasy forest bioma.

This project was a product of completing the Udemy course: RPG Core Combat Creator made by GameDev.tv

## Future work
Although this project was first taken as an introduction to Design Patterns in videogames and architectural programming design, it could be polished on combat interaction, a better non-linear proggresion system, dialog and storytelling, and much more ideas I have in mind.
